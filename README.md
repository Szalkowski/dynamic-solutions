In this test task I had to create a simple website with two subpages. One of them is with form for fill details about
user second one is for display those details.

To make this task I've decided to use React. It's simple javascript library to use with full of packages those could be
installed when needed. One of them is for validate forms which save time of developing app. This package
add errors when they appear checks fields for us handle submit form, checks which field was edited. Of course I could
create
validation by myself like long time ago just by simple javascript and check required or patterns of fields. Second
package that replaced browser's sessionstorage is Redux. It's make app faster and extend its possibility for API
requests. Holds app state separately and developers friendly.

React let us build websites with routing so no need to reload page after it's change so users are more happy because of
it's performance.

I've created styles using SASS preprocessor. It's pure CSS but better and like for me is more readable and reusable than
styled-components. In easy
way let us provide simple reusable functions ie. for responsive styles or converting pixels to rem. Also nesting is
easier
than in styled-components. In the past BEM was also great invention and can still be used successfully in SASS way.

More than that React is installed with configured Webpack what is the best solution now. No need to configure everything
from hand and write scripts like in Grunt or Gulp.

I think I have crated readable, modern but in old school app, which is easy to compile, deploy, and further development
and maintenance.
